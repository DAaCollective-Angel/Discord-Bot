This Privacy Policy explains how the DAa Discord bot handles user data. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described here.

## Data We Collect
- **Discord User Data**: User IDs, usernames, and server IDs may be stored to provide bot functionality.  
- **Command Usage**: We may log commands executed to improve features and troubleshoot issues.  
- **Optional Data**: If the bot requires additional information (e.g., preferences, settings), this will be explicitly requested.  

## How We Use Data
- To provide bot features and respond to commands.  
- To improve performance, fix bugs, and add new functionality.  
- To maintain moderation logs if the bot is used for server management.  

## Data Sharing
- We do **not** sell or share user data with third parties.  
- Data may be shared only if required by law or to comply with Discord’s Terms of Service.  

## Data Retention
- Logs and stored data are kept only as long as necessary for functionality.  
- Users may request deletion of their data by contacting the bot maintainers.  

## Security
We take reasonable steps to protect stored data, but no system is 100% secure. Use the Bot at your own risk.

## Contact
For questions or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, contact the maintainers via GitHub Issues or Discord.
